# AUV_project

This is the code used in the project "Exploiting domain knowledge to enhance reinforcement learning in Robotic Marine Environmental Monitoring". 

The project aims to illustrate that simple hard coded rules can enhcance improve the results of reinforcement learning in the right conditions.

## Usage
The utilies for interractig with the evironment is ownd and maintained by NGI (The Norwegian geotechnical institute), and the simulation files, including conroll of the AUV, is not in the public domain, so this project cannot be run without their cooperation.

After cloning the project, navigate to the project folder, and run the shell command 

```
pip install .
```

If you do not have Python installed, you need to download it from python.org, and follow the installation instructions there.

Afterwards run the command
```
python pip upgrade && pip install .
```
